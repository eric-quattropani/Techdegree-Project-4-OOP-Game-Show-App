# Techdegree Project 4 OOP Game Show App
 
This is my attempt at the Techdegree Project 4 OOP Game Show App.

I found it overall fairly difficult, however it was easily the most satisfying project thus far! It was a lot of fun seeing it come together. More importantly, I'm getting more confident at using query selectors which I used think were quite confusing to use.
